Welcome! I am a research assistant affiliated with the [CUHK-Shenzhen NLP group](https://freedomintelligence.github.io/), under the guidance of Dr. [Benyou Wang](https://wabyking.github.io/old.html). I obtained my M.E. from the [Software Institute](https://software.nju.edu.cn/ "NJU SE") and the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/homepage/ "NJU NLP") at Nanjing University, advised by Dr. [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) and Dr. [Jidong Ge](https://gjdnju.github.io/). Prior to this, I completed my B.E. at the [Software Institute](https://software.nju.edu.cn/ "NJU SE") of Nanjing University.

## Research Overview

My research interests are in Natural Language Processing, especially **intelligent interactive systems** ü§ñ and **Domain-specific LLMs** üë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è and the following directions:
* **Multimodal LLM** [\[MileBench\]](https://milebench.github.io/)
* **Medical LLM:** [\[CMB\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08833), [\[HuatuoGPT-II\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09774)
* **Multilingual LLM:** [\[AceGPT\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12053)
* **Task-oriented dialogue systems:** [\[EPL, NLPCC 2023 Oral\]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-44693-1_3), [\[STAM, JCST 2023\]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11390-022-2029-5)

<!-- My primary research interests lie in natural language processing and deep learning. My long-term goal in the research is to build an intelligent system that can understand users‚Äô needs and solve real-world problems. I commenced a deep dive into low-resource learning and dialogue systems toward this goal. More specifically, I was interested in building a conversational agent that can be rapidly deployed in low-resource scenarios (e.g., medical domain). My current research focuses on building models for generalization and extrapolation to new tasks/domains, involving studies in zero-shot and few-shot learning. -->



## Updates

**April 2024**: **MileBench** üõ£Ô∏è released! MileBench is a pioneering benchmark designed to rigorously test the **MultImodal Long-contExt capabilities of MLLMs**.  More information can be found on the [üåê website](https://milebench.github.io/), [üìÉ paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18532), [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/MileBench) and the [GitHub](https://github.com/MileBench/MileBench).

**March 2024**: üéâüéâ Two papers [CMB](https://cmedbenchmark.llmzoo.com/#home) and [AceGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12053) were accepted to [NAACL'24](https://2024.naacl.org/) main conference!

**Nov 2023**: HuatuoGPT2 released! Try it out on the [üåê demo](https://www.huatuogpt.cn/#/)! HuatuoGPT2 employs an innovative domain adaptation method to significantly boost its medical knowledge and dialogue proficiency and showcases SOTA performance in several medical benchmarks, especially **surpassing GPT-4 in expert evaluations and the fresh medical licensing exams**. More info can be found in [üìÉ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09774) and [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/FreedomIntelligence/HuatuoGPT2-34B).

**Sep 2023**: We publish AceGPT that achieved **top performance** among open-source Arabic language models in benchmark tests. More info can be found in [üìÉ paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12053) and [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/FreedomIntelligence/AceGPT-13B-chat).

**Aug 2023**: [Checkout our üìÉ new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08833) that focuses on benchmarking prevalent Medical LLMs for their medical knowledge and clinical diagnostic capabilities. More information can be found on the [üåê website](https://cmedbenchmark.llmzoo.com/#home) and the [ü§ó HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/CMB).

**Jul 2023**: Start the journey in CUHK-sz as a research assistant under the guidance of [Benyou Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Jk4vJU8AAAAJ).

**Jun 2023**: I defended my master's degree and got my master's degree in software engineering. Thanks to all those who have supported me.

**Aug 2022 - Apr 2023**: Finished my internship with [Jiaxing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ozXuhOUAAAAJ) on LLM SFT.
